- **Permission Issues**: 
  - On Linux/macOS, use `sudo` if you encounter permission errors
  - On Windows, run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator

- **PATH Not Working**: 
  - Restart your terminal/command prompt after modifying PATH
  - Verify the path is correctly added

## Getting Started
