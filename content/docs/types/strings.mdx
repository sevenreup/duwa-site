# Mawu (Strings)

A string is a sequence of characters. In Duwa, Mawu (String) is a type that represents strings. It is used to represent text values. These strings are UTF-8 encoded.

## Syntax

```duwa
mawu x = "Hello, World!";
```

## Examples usage

```duwa
mawu x = "Hello, World!";
Khonso.lemba(x);
```

## Escape Sequences

Duwa supports the following escape sequences in strings:

- `\"` - double quote
- `\\` - backslash
- `\n` - newline
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\t` - tab
- `\u{}` - Unicode code point

```duwa
mawu x = "Hello, \"World\"!";
mawu y = "Hello, \nWorld!";
mawu z = "Hello, \u{1F600}!";
```

## Conversion to Mawu

To explicitly convert a value to a string, you can use the `kuMawu` function.

### Nambala

Numbers are converted to their string representation.

```duwa
mawu x = kuMawu(10);
Khonso.lemba(x); // "10"
```

### Tsimikizi

`zoona` is converted to `"zoona"` and `bodza` is converted to `"bodza"`.

```duwa
mawu x = kuMawu(zoona);
Khonso.lemba(x); // "zoona"
```

### Array

Arrays are converted to their string representation.

```duwa
mawu x = kuMawu([1, 2, 3]);
Khonso.lemba(x); // "[1, 2, 3]"
```

### Classes

Classes are converted to their string representation.

```duwa
Munthu munthu = Munthu();
mawu x = kuMawu(munthu);
Khonso.lemba(x); // "Munthu"
```

> Note: Convertion from other types to string is not supported yet. (If it works, it's a bug)
