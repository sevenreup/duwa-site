# Nambala (Number)

In Duwa, Nambala (Number) is a type that represents numbers. It is used to represent numeric values.
Numbers in Duwa are represented using the IEEE 754 standard. In duwa there no difference between integers and floating point numbers.

## Syntax

```duwa
nambala x = 10;
nambala y = 10.0;
```

## Examples usage

```duwa
nambala x = 10;
nambala y = 10.0;

nambala z = x + y;
Khonso.lemba(z);
```

## Conversion to Nambala

To explicitly convert a value to a number, you can use the `kuNambala` function.

### strings

If the string is a valid number, it will be converted to a number. Otherwise, it will be converted to `0`.

```duwa
nambala x = kuNambala("10");
Khonso.lemba(x); // 10
```

### Tsimikizi

`zoona` is converted to `1` and `bodza` is converted to `0`.

```duwa
nambala x = kuNambala(zoona);
Khonso.lemba(x); // 1
```

> Note: Convertion from other types to number is not supported yet. (If it works, it's a bug)
