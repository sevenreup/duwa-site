## Palibe (Null)

The `palibe` is used to represent the absence of a value. In Duwa, `palibe` is a special value that is used to indicate that a variable does not have a value. 
It is similar to `null` in other programming languages.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use the `palibe` in Duwa:

### Initializing a variable
Below we are initializing a variable `x` of type `nambala` with no value.
```duwa
nambala x = palibe;
```

### Returning a value from a function
```duwa
ndondomeko palibeValue() {
    // Do some work
   bweza palibe;
}
```

### Checking for a null value
```duwa
nambala x = palibe;
ngati(x == palibe) {
    // Do something
}
```
