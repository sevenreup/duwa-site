## Types

Every variable in Duwa has a type. The type of a variable determines the kind of data it can store. Duwa has a rich type system that includes the following types:

### Built-in types

- [Nambala (Number)](/docs/types/number)
- [Mawu (String)](/docs/types/strings)
- [Tsimikizi (Boolean)](/docs/types/boolean)
- [Array](/docs/types/array)
- [Palibe (Null)](/docs/types/null)

### User-defined types

- [Classes](/docs/types/classes)

### Callable types

- [Ndondomeko (Function)](/docs/basics/functions)

## Type Annotations

To explicitly specify the type of a variable, you can use a type annotation. To specify the type of a variable, you use the name of the type followed by the variable name. For example, to specify that a variable `x` is a number, you would write `number x`.

```duwa
nambala x = 42;
mawu y = "Hello, world!";
```

## Type Inference

Duwa is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. However, Duwa also supports type inference, which means that the type of a variable can be inferred from its value. This allows you to write code without explicitly specifying the type of each variable.

> Note: Type inference is not yet implemented in Duwa.

## Type Conversion

You can convert a value from one type to another using a type conversion. Duwa provides built-in functions for converting between types. For example, you can convert a string to a number using the `kuNambala` function.

```duwa
mawu x = "42";
nambala y = kuNambala(x);
```

You can find more information about type conversion in the documentation for each type.
