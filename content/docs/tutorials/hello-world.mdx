# Hello World

Welcome to this tutorial where we'll create a more engaging version of the traditional "Hello World" program. Instead of just printing text, we'll build an interactive program that teaches fundamental programming concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:

- Basic input and output operations
- String manipulation
- Control flow (if statements and loops)
- Function definition

## Prerequisites

- Duwa installed on your machine (Follow the instructions for [installation](/docs#installation)) or use the [playground](/playground).
- A text editor or IDE

## Part 1: Setting Up the Function

Let's start by creating our main function. This function will greet the user and ask for their name.:

```duwa
ndondomeko moni_kwa_munthu() {
}
```

**Why This Matters**:

- Functions help organize code into reusable blocks

## Part 2: Getting User Input

```duwa
Khonso.lemba("Mwalandiridwa!");

Khonso.lemba("Dzina lako ndi chiyani?");
mawu dzina = Khonso.landira();
```

## Part 3: Adding String Manipulation

Next, let's add some string handling:
